## BoxOfDevs 📦
### We develop.
### We get stuff done.
### We are the BoxOfDevs Team. 

Hello! We're a small team of devs founded in April 2016. Originally making plugins for PocketMine-MP and for our preferred fork, ImagicalMine, much of our community has become distanced from those original needs. 
You can find some of us still active on the discord at [https://boxofdevs.com/discord](https://boxofdevs.com/discord) , and find some fleeting projects on this organization page.

Thanks for visiting!
